# M101 Mosaic Montage Workflow with HTCondor
For this project, we have decided on using a HTCondor cluster of 3 virtual machines running on  Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10 that was setup on Amazon Web Serviceâ€™s Elastic  Computing Cloud (EC2) servers. 

This setup was created to run a Montage m101 Mosaic workflow  where the output will be two mosaics of m101 and their corresponding area images. A linear  DAGMan workflow and a parallelized DAGMan workflow were created and executed to measure  the performance and efficiency of the workflows to see which one is better.



## :bulb: Running the program

To run the Linear DAG Workflow, type the following command:
```
$ condor_submit_dag run.dag
```
To run the Parallelized DAG Workflow, type the following command:
```
$ condor_submit_dag runparallel.dag
```
To check the status and progress of the job submisson, type the following command:
```
$ ls
$ condor_q
$ condor_q -nobatch
```
